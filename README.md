Java Agent Development Framework source code.

This project is a fork of the JADE Framework (4.5) motivated by the fact that the team that successfully developed it cannot continue to work on it anymore.
We cannot thank them enough for the contribution they have made to the field of multi-agent systems, and we hope, by setting up this repository, that the community will be able to pursue their work and the dissemination of multi-agent approaches.

All contribution are welcome.

See website for more details.
